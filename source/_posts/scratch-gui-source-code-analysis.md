# Entry Function Overview

```jsx
const appTarget = document.createElement('div');
appTarget.className = styles.app;
document.body.appendChild(appTarget)

if (supportedBrowser()) {
    // require needed here to avoid importing unsupported browser-crashing code
    // at the top level
    require('./render-gui.jsx').default(appTarget);

} else {
    BrowserModalComponent.setAppElement(appTarget);
    const WrappedBrowserModalComponent = AppStateHOC(BrowserModalComponent, true /* localesOnly */);
    const handleBack = () => {};
    // eslint-disable-next-line react/jsx-no-bind
    ReactDOM.render(<WrappedBrowserModalComponent onBack={handleBack} />, appTarget);
});
```

## Utilizing CSS Modules

The `appTarget.className = styles.app` leverages CSS Modules, a technique that scopes class names by automatically generating unique identifiers.This strategy effectively prevents styling conflicts across components. Even if multiple components use a `.app` class, CSS Modules ensure that each class name, such as `index_app_2mqDO` , is unique and scoped to its components. This isolation is achieved through specific webpack configuration:

```js
 {
     test: /\.css$/,
     use: [{
        loader: 'style-loader'
     }, {
         loader: 'css-loader',
         options: {
         modules: true,
         importLoaders: 1,
         localIdentName: '[name]_[local]_[hash:base64:5]',
         camelCase: true
        }...]
 }
```

## Ensuring Browser Compatibility

The core functionality of the snippet involves checking for browser compatibility. This is crucial for preventing the application from crashing in un supported browsers. If the browser is compatible, the application's GUI rendering module is dynamically required and executed. By this way, it ensures that potentially incompatible code is not loaded upfront, enhancing performance and stability. (bowser check by using [bowser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bowser)).

In cases where the browser is not supported, the code gracefully handles this scenario by utilizing a modal component to inform the user. This is facilitated by libraries such as [react-intl(Format.JS)](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/) for internationalization and react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) for rendering modeldialogs.



## Runtime Props type checking

Although JavaScript lacks the type checking capabilities of TypeScript, runtime type checking is employed via [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) to ensure the integrity of prop types across components.



## State management

The project uses redux for state management, I commonly used framework is vue, state management is currently used pinia, there are still some obvious differences between them, redux is relatively not as intuitive and convenient as pinia, but provides a high degree of flexibility, controllability.
